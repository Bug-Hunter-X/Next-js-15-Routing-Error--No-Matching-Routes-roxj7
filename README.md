# Next.js 15 Routing Error: No Matching Routes

This repository demonstrates a common routing error in Next.js 15 applications where the application throws an error indicating that the route `/` has no matching routes, even though a seemingly correct `pages/index.js` file exists.  The problem often stems from issues with the Next.js configuration or unexpected behavior with the file system.

## Bug

The primary problem is that the application, despite a seemingly correct `pages/index.js`, fails to find a matching route. This is commonly caused by incorrect file paths or hidden issues with the project's file structure. This example uses a standard Next.js 15 application setup. 

## Solution

The solution addresses potential problems with the project directory structure, ensuring the `pages/index.js` file is correctly positioned within the project and accessible to Next.js. The solution also emphasizes thorough verification of the file path and project setup to avoid common pitfalls.
